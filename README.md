<h1>Island Horizons</h1>

Island Horizons is an Animal Crossing: New Horizons fansite and blog, created with Gatsby, and Contentful as a CMS. It was inspired by:

<ol>
<li> My frustration of always getting the wrong prices for fish/bugs when I'd Google them... (inspiring the Critters portion)</li>
<li>The mistakes I was making early on in the game... (inspiring the blog portion)</li>
</ol>
