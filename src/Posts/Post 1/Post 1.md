### 1. Plan. Plan. Plan.

While you _can_ decide to move buildings and bridges/inclines later on in the game (for a price), it would'be been nice to have planned things out a little more carefully. Going in, I just wanted myself and my 2 villagers to have as much space as possible. Was I thinking ahead, and planning to house 10 villagers, 2 stores and a museum? Not at all. If I were, I would've saved a lot of bells.

### 2. Maximize your rock's resources by digging holes behind them.

You can hit each rock up to 8 times, if you don't get thrown around.

### 3. Don't eat more fruit than necessary...

Eating fruit gives you super-strength, so you are able to dig up trees or destroy rocks, which is very convinient when you want to move things around!

### 4. ALWAYS have your net in hand while shaking trees.

Trees

### 5. There's always money in the... money trees?

### 6. If more than one user uses the same copy of Animal Crossing on the same switch, plan to share your island.

It's annoying.
